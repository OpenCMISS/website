:slug: status

Updated on **25 September 2015**.

Source files and instructions to build this website are now available on `GitHub <https://github.com/inkybutton/OpenCMISS-Documentation>`_. This is currently in a personal GitHub account as the repository plan is still being decided.

Please send any feedback and suggestions to `Noel Zeng, the developer working on the project <mailto:bioeng-webmaster@auckland.ac.nz>`_.
